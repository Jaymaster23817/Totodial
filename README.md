Pokemon gold/silver rom hack that calls your phone when you receive phone calls in game.

Included in your PokeGear is a phone that trainers and friends can use to call you in game.
Well who's to say those calls can't come to you in real life? With this ROM hack, calls in the
virtual Pokemon world will trigger calls in real life using Lua and Twilio.
